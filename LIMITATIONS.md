# Known Limitations and Future Improvements

## Recently Fixed Issues

### v1.0.2 Bug Fixes

  - **Impact**: Export buttons now properly appear when hovering over transcription area

### v1.0.1 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: `addTranscriptionItem is not defined` error during recording start
  - **Issue**: Function name mismatch between call and definition
  - **Resolution**: Corrected function call from `addTranscriptionItem` to `addTranscriptionToUI`
  - **Impact**: Recording functionality now works properly

## Current Limitations

### Technical Constraints

#### Audio Capture Limitations
- **Chrome Tab Limit**: Browser limits simultaneous tab audio capture
- **Audio Quality Dependency**: Higher quality increases processing time and file size
- **Tab Permission**: Requires user interaction to capture audio from tabs
- **Background Limitations**: Chrome restrictions on background audio processing

#### API Dependencies
- **Internet Requirement**: All transcription requires active internet connection
- **Provider Rate Limits**: Each AI provider has specific rate and quota limitations
- **API Key Management**: Users must obtain and configure their own API keys
- **Service Availability**: Dependent on third-party AI service uptime

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome Only**: Extension specifically designed for Chrome Manifest V3
- **Version Requirement**: Requires Chrome 88+ for full functionality
- **Platform Specific**: Desktop Chrome only (mobile Chrome not supported)

### Performance Constraints

#### Memory Usage
- **Buffer Size**: 30-second audio chunks require temporary memory storage
- **Multiple Tabs**: Each additional tab increases memory footprint
- **Long Sessions**: Extended recording sessions may accumulate memory usage

#### Processing Limitations
- **Real-time Delay**: 30-second chunks create inherent delay in transcription
- **CPU Usage**: Multiple simultaneous recordings impact system performance
- **Network Bandwidth**: Large audio files require adequate internet speed

### Functional Limitations

#### Transcription Accuracy
- **Audio Quality**: Poor audio quality affects transcription accuracy
- **Background Noise**: Ambient noise can impact transcription quality
- **Multiple Speakers**: Overlapping voices may reduce accuracy
- **Language Support**: Limited to languages supported by chosen AI provider

#### User Experience
- **Setup Complexity**: Users must configure API keys manually
- **Provider Selection**: Switching providers requires reconfiguration
- **Error Handling**: Network failures require manual retry in some cases
